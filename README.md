# Ionic Gallery ðŸ“¸
This is the starter project Ionic offers to help people learn how to use the framework, how their prebuilt components work, and how it can integrate easily with a web framework like React to produce web apps, native-like mobile apps (via Capacitor), and desktop apps (via Electron).

#### CURRENT FEATURES ðŸŒŸ
- Image Upload: Users may click on the FAB icon to either take a photo via their camera, or to upload an image saved in their files.
- Photo Gridview: Uploaded photos are saved into storage, and displayed as a grid on desktop, or in a finite row on mobile.
- Delete Photo: Users may click on uploaded photos and choose to delete the photo from storage.

#### WHAT DID I LEARN ðŸ’¡
The idea of creating cross-platform apps under one codebase has intrigued me ever since I learned that it's possible to do with web technologies. I think that Ionic was the best framework to use to let me explore this idea because it allows me to simultaneously practice React while learning how to utilize Ionic's prebuilt UI components. From this project, I've practiced using and making custom React hooks, learned how to use Capacitor to access hardware functionality, and how to store things permanently in a web app.
